# Vanilla-JS-todo-list

This app was created to solidify my knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. By coding in vanilla JS rather than using librares or frameworks I was able to increase my understanding of the code that runs behind the scenes in such tools. To style the app I used a mobile first approach to strengthen my skills in designing with this workflow. I also used building this app as an opportunity to learn SASS and have found it to massively boost my productivity and have used it on every project since!
